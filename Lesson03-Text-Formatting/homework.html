    <h1>Abel Mekonnen</h1>
    <h2>Welcome To My Page</h2>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My Name is <b>Abel</b> I am in the <i>9th grade</i>.<br>
     I enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, sports, and biking. <br>
     In my extra free time I enjoy digital entertainment like shows/movies <br>
     as well as video games. When im not playing games, watching shows, or <br>
     outside im usually inside studying or taking naps which I do often. <br>
     I'm Christian and go to Church on Sundays with my family. I also enjoy <br>
     hanging out with friends after school. </p> <br> <hr>


    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
  <p>My favorite hobby is a video game called <strong>Rocket Leauge</strong>.<br>
     Rocket Leauge is a game where cars are used in order to shoot a ball into a soccer net. <br>
 <em>Essentialy Rocket Leauge is soccer exept instead of humans playing <br>
     it's cars controlled by humans that can dribble, shoot, and pass just as a normal <br>
     soccer game would go.</em> Rocket Leauge is a game that encourages creativity which creates <br>
     an addicting affect that can be revealed by the fact that I have <br>
     spent 2 days 17 hours and 25 minutes on this game.</p> <br>

 <h3>Other Things I like</h3>
  <p>Smaller interests of mine include but are not limited to <strong>photography</strong> which I have just <br>
     recently started, <strong>gardening</strong> which I started about 2 months ago (a cactus was my first plant <br>
     in my collection), and keeping up with <strong>stocks</strong> and learning more about the stock market. <br>
     <em>For me activities/hobbies are ways to relax from work and pursue the things that interest us.</em> </p> <hr>
